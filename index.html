            <p class="text"><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco" target="_blank">Jacque Fresco</a> was a man ahead of his time, a visionary who did not intend to predict the future, but rather attempted to create it with his knowledge and craft. Born in Brooklyn in 1916, Fresco became a self-taught industrial designer, architect and social engineer, who made it his life-goal to improve the world in which he lived, through the social and environmentally conscious application of science and technology.</p>
            <p class="text">Having lived through some of the worst periods of the 20th century (the Great Depression, WWII, the Cold War, etc), Jacque was able to see the underlying problems of modern society. As a result of these experiences, he realized a major change was needed in our current economies and systems of beliefs, in order to solve mankind’s problems. He envisioned a world in which humans could live truly fulfilling lives, free from the burden of labor, the rule of money, and the social afflictions generated by an economy of scarcity. A future by design, in which a technologically developed society could share a borderless planet and all of its resources, living in peace and prosperity.

What I suggest is applying the methods of science to the social system for the benefit of humankind and the environment."</p>

            <h4>"The Venus Project"</h4>
            <p class="text"><a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/" target="_blank">The Venus Project</a>, named after their 21-acres research center in Venus, Florida, represents both the culmination and genesis of Jacque and his associate Roxanne Meadows’ social project. Intended as a real-life materialization of their ideas and goals, the research center is the gravitational nucleus of the movement and serves as a means of promoting interest in the project. The center also represents the first stage in the process of bringing the resource-based society to life, which is followed by a period of public education on their views and proposals, through documentaries and a major film, in order to finally establish a model city that would put into practice the project’s concepts, and eventually grow into a network of similar cities around the world.</p>

            <h4>Main Ideas</h4>
            <ul class="text">
              <li>Money is an outdated form of economic regulation, which inevitably leads to inequality and corruption.</li>
              <li>Humans are cultural beings who act accordingly to the ideas and values they have been brought up to. There is no inherently good or bad human nature.</li>
              <li>A resource-based economy is the only sustainable way to preserve human life on earth for the generations to come.</li>
              <li>Natural resources must be declared the common heritage of all of humanity.</li>
              <li>Human labor is inefficient, and should be replaced by world-wide interconnected automated systems.</li>
              <li>People’s true potential is reached when they are free to work in the projects they are actually passionate about.</li>
              <li>In order to change the world in which we live, we have to change the way we think about it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text">Jacque Fresco’s ideas and projects for a redesigned world culture, flawed and perfectible as they might be, should become a beacon for current and future generations, lighting the way for a more advanced and humane civilization. May this page serve as its author’s humble homage to Mr. Fresco’s vision, and contribute to spread his ideas throughout the world.</p>
